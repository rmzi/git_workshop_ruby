# Git Workshop in Ruby

1. Walk participants through the existing code + show it running
	* Run `bundle install` from within the root directory to install rspec.
    * If you don't have bundle installed, run `sudo gem install bundle`
      * If you don't have gem installed, see [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](here)

2. Show participants how to create branches. This is probably a good time to talk about the specific branching strategy being employed at an organizational level. Then, have a participant pair up and implement subtraction in a new branch.

3. After finishing the code additions, commit and push to the new branch and show thew new branch in Github. Then, start a pull request to show participants the value of peer review via pull requests.

4. After another group vets the change, they should accept this change and squash and merge the PR.

5. Continue to iterate on this by adding multiplication and division.

6. Profit.
